    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><em>Dal fry</em> is a comforting Indian lentil dish made with simmered lentils, spices, onions, and tomatoes. Despite its name, there's no deep frying involved. It's a hearty and flavorful dish typically served with rice or flatbreads. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> <strong>Lentils:</strong> Typically toor dal (split pigeon peas) but some variations use masoor dal (red lentils) or a combination.</li>
        <li> <strong>Aromatics:</strong> Ginger, garlic, and green chilies.</li>
        <li> <strong>Spices:</strong> Cumin seeds, mustard seeds, turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, and asafoetida (optional).</li>
        <li> <strong>Vegetables:</strong> Onion and tomato.</li>
        <li> <strong>Fat:</strong> Ghee or oil.</li>
        <li> <strong>For garnish:</strong> Fresh coriander leaves.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps to make</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong>Rinse and cook the lentils:</strong> Wash your lentils and pressure cook them with water and a pinch of turmeric until soft and mushy. You can also boil them in a pot on the stovetop.</li>
        <li> <strong>Make the tadka (tempering):</strong> Heat ghee or oil in a pan. Add cumin seeds, mustard seeds, and let them splutter. Add asafoetida (a pinch, optional), chopped ginger, garlic, and green chilies. Saute for a minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li> <strong>Saut√© the onions and tomatoes:</strong> Add chopped onions and cook until softened. Add chopped tomatoes and cook until mushy and the masala thickens.</li>
        <li> <strong>Spice it up:</strong> Stir in red chili powder, turmeric, and garam masala. Cook for a minute, releasing the aroma of the spices.</li>
        <li> <strong>Combine and simmer:</strong> Add the cooked lentils and water (adjust for desired consistency). Season with salt. Simmer for a few minutes to let the flavors meld.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnish and serve:</strong> Turn off heat, stir in fresh coriander leaves. Serve hot with rice or flatbreads.</li>
    </ol>
