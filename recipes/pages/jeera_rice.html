    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> <em>Jeera Rice</em> is a simple yet flavorful Indian rice dish.It's made with fluffy basmati rice cooked with aromatic cumin seeds and often other whole spices like cardamom and cloves. The dish is fragrant with a warm, earthy cumin aroma and pairs perfectly with curries or dals. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> <strong>Rice:</strong> Basmati rice is preferred for its long grains and fluffy texture.</li>
        <li> <strong>Fat:</strong> Ghee (clarified butter) or oil for adding richness.</li>
        <li> <strong>Cumin seeds (Jeera):</strong> The star ingredient that gives the dish its name and flavor.</li>
        <li> <strong>Optional whole spices:</strong> Bay leaf,cloves, cardamom pods, cinnamon stick - these add extra depth of flavor.</li>
        <li> <strong>Salt:</strong> to taste</li>
        <li> <strong>For garnish:</strong> Fresh coriander leaves.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps to make</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong>Rinse the rice:</strong> Wash your basmati rice in cool water until the water runs clear. Soaking for 20-30 minutes (optional) can further improve texture.</li>
        <li> <strong>Heat the fat:</strong> In a pot or pressure cooker, heat ghee or oil over medium heat.</li>
        <li> <strong>Temper the spices:</strong> Add cumin seeds and any optional whole spices (bay leaf, cardamom, etc.) to the hot fat. Fry until the cumin releases its fragrant aroma.</li>
        <li> <strong>Saut√© the rice (optional):</strong> You can briefly saute the rinsed rice in the hot oil for a minute to enhance its flavor.</li>
        <li> <strong>Add water and salt:</strong> Pour in water (typically 1.5-2 parts water to 1 part rice) and add salt to taste.</li>
        <li> <strong>Bring to a boil and simmer:</strong> Increase heat to bring the water to a boil. Then, reduce heat to low, cover the pot or pressure cooker, and simmer the rice according to your chosen method:
    <ul>
        <li> <strong>Stovetop method:</strong> Simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through and all the water is absorbed. Fluff the rice with a fork before serving.</li>
        <li> <strong>Pressure cooker method:</strong> Cook for 2-3 whistles on medium flame. Let the pressure release naturally for 5-10 minutes before opening the cooker. Fluff the rice gently.</li>
    </ul>
        <li> <strong>Garnish (optional):</strong> Stir in chopped fresh coriander leaves for a touch of green and freshness before serving.</li>
    </ol>
